Problem Description

You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i ≠ j. Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 10^9+7.


Problem Constraints

    1 <= N <= 105
    1 <= A[i] <= 109
    1 <= B <= 109


Input Format

First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.


Output Format

Return an integer.


    Example Input
    Input 1:
    
    A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
    B = 4
    Input 2:
    
    A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
    B = 1
    
    
    Example Output
    Output 1:
    
    1
    Output 2:
    
    4


Example Explanation

Example 1:


The only pair is (2, 3) which gives difference as 4

Example 2:

The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3).
