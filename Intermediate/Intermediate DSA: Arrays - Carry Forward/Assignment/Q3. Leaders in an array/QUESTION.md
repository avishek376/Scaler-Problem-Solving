Problem Description

Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.

Problem Constraints

    1 <= N <= 105
    1 <= A[i] <= 108
    Input Format

There is a single input argument which a integer array A
Output Format

Return an integer array denoting all the **leader elements** of the array.
NOTE: Ordering in the output doesn't matter.
    
    Example Input
    
     A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
    
    Example Output
    
     [17, 2, 5]

Example Explanation

 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return this three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.
