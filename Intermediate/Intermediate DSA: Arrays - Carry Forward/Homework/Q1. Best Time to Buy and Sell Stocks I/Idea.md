If you buy your stock on day i, youâ€™d obviously want to sell it on the day its price is maximum after that day.
So essentially at every index i, you need to find the maximum in the array in the suffix.
Now this part can be done in 2 ways :
1) Have another array which stores that information.
max[i] = max(max[i+1], A[i])

2) Start processing entries from the end maintaining a maximum till now. Constant additional space requirement.
