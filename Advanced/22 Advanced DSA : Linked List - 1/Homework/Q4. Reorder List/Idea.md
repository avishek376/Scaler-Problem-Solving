We can try to break down the solution approach into majorly three parts.

Firstly, we try to break the list from the middle into two separate linked lists.
Now, we reverse the latter half of the linked list.
Finally, we would merge the lists so that the nodes alternate to get the required answer.


    TC: O(N)
    SC: O(1)
