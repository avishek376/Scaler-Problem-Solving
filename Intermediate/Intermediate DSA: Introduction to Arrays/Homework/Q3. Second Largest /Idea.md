First, we iterate over each element in the list and find the largest element. Letâ€™s say max_elem.
Then, we again iterate over each element in the list using a for loop and find the largest element, but we also check if that element is equal to max_elem, if it is we skip it.


    TC: O(NlogN)
    SC: O(1)
