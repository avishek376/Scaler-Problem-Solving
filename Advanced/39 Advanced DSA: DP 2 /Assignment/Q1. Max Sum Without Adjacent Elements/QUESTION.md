Problem Description

Given a 2 x N grid of integers, A, your task is to choose numbers from the grid such that sum of these numbers is maximized. 
However, you cannot choose two numbers that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Return the maximum possible sum.

Note: You are allowed to choose more than 2 numbers from the grid.
