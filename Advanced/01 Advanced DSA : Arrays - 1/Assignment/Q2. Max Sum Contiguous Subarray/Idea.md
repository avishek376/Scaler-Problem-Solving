Let us say Ai, Ai+1 … Aj is our optimal solution.

Note that no prefix of the solution will ever have a negative sum.

Let us say Ai … Ak prefix had a negative sum.

Sum ( Ai Ai+1 … Aj ) = Sum (Ai … Ak) + Sum(Ak+1 … Aj)

Sum ( Ai Ai+1 … Aj) - Sum(Ak+1 … Aj) = Sum(Ai … Ak)

Now, since Sum(Ai … Ak) < 0,

Sum (Ai Ai+1 … Aj) - Sum (Ak+1 … Aj) < 0

which means Sum(Ak+1 … Aj ) > Sum (Ai Ai+1 … Aj)

This contradicts the fact that Ai, Ai+1 … Aj is our optimal solution.

Instead, Ak+1, Ak+2 … Aj will be our optimal solution.

Similarly, you can prove that it is always good to include a prefix with a positive sum for the optimal solution.

Try to come up with a solution based on the previous 2 facts.

Here’s one Approach.
Keep two variables ‘curSum’ and ‘maxSum’ which denotes the current sum ending at the given position and the maximum sum of a subarray respectively.
Iterate through the array , at every index we will add the current element to our curSum , after this we can update the maxSum as max(maxSum,curSum), After this we can just check if curSum is less than 0 , if it is then just replace curSum with 0.
