Calculate the next greater element and previous greater element for each element in the array. Each element Ai is the maximum of all subarrays starting at (previous greater element)i + 1 to (next greater element)i - 1.

Similarly, the next smaller element and previous smaller element can be used for minimum values of subarrays
