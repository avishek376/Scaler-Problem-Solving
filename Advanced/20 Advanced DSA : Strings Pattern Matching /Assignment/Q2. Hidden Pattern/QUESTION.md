Problem Description

Given two strings - a text A and a pattern B, having lower-case alphabetic characters. You have to determine the number of occurrences of pattern B in text A as its substring. i.e. the number of times B occurs as a substring in A.



Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= |B| <= |A| <= 105



Input Format

First argument is a string A

Second argument is a string B



Output Format

Return the number of occurrences.



Example Input

    Input 1:
    
     A = "abababa"
     B = "aba" 
    Input 2:
    
     A = "mississipi"
     B = "ss" 
    Input 3:
    
     A = "hello" 
     B = "hi" 
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
     3 
    Output 2:
    
     2 
    Output 3:
    
     0 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 A has 3 substrings equal to B - A[1, 3], A[3, 5] and A[5, 7] 

Explanation 2:

 B occurs two times in A - A[3, 4], A[6, 7]. 

Explanation 3:

 B does not occur in A as a substring.
