Construct a class called Matrix which stores a 2D Array. It should store

The number of rows

The number of columns

The 2D Array itself

Implement the following functionalities inside this class :-

input() -> Reads the input from the user. This method should read the input from the user and populate the entire array. Each row will be in a new line and all the elements in a row will be space-separated.

add(Matrix) -> Returns the sum of two matrices. Assume the matrices provided have the same dimensions.

subtract(Matrix) -> Returns the sum of two matrices. Assume the matrices provided have the same dimensions.

transpose() -> Returns a new matrix containing the transpose of the given original matrix.

print() -> prints the entire matrix row by row. Each row will be in a new line and values in each row should be separated by a single space.

You may define any properties in the class as you see appropriate.
