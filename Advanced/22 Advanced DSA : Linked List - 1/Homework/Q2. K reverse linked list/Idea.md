The given linked list can be split into buckets of length K. For doing this; you can use two pointers that are K elements apart in the linked
list.

Now, let us try to solve the problem for one bucket, i.e., reversing
a single linked list. For this, you can check this.

So now, our problem has been modified to solve the problem for each bucket and then concatenating the lists to get a final
K-reversed linked list which is just an implementation issue.

    SC: O(1)
