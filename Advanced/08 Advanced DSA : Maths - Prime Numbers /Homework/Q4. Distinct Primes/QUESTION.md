You have given an array A having N integers. Let say G is the product of all elements of A.

You have to find the number of distinct prime divisors of G.



Input Format

The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.

Output Format

Return an Integer, i.e number of distinct prime divisors of G.

Constraints

    1 <= N <= 1e5
    1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
    For Example

Input:

    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output:

     2

Explanation:

    here G = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
    and distinct prime divisors of G are [2, 3]
