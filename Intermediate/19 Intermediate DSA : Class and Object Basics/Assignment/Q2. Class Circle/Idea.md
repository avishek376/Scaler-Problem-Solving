First, you need define properties of circle. To define a circle, only one property “radius” is required.

Then, you need to define constructor
Constructor is a special function with same name as class name and no return type.
Generally, it is used to initialise the properties of class.

perimeter() -
perimeter of a circle is 2 * pi * r, where value of pi is 3.14 and r is radius.

area() -
area of a circle is pi * r * r, where value of pi is 3.14 and r is radius.

Note - Please do check the return type before returning.
If you are getting a double value and you need to return float value, then typecasting will be needed.
