Problem Description

Given heads of two linked lists A and B, check if they are identical i.e. each of their corresponding nodes should contain the same data. The two given linked lists may or may not be of the same length.


Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= size of linked lists <= 105
    
    1 <= value of each node <= 109



Input Format

You are given the head of two linked lists A and B.


Output Format

Return 1 if both the linked lists are identical and 0 otherwise

    
    Example Input
    Input 1:
    
    A = 1 -> 2 -> 3
    
    B = 1 -> 2 -> 3
    
    Input 2:
    
    A = 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
    
    B = 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
    1
    Output 2:
    
    0
    

Example Explanation

For Input 1:

Both the linked lists are identical

For Input 2:

The value in the second node of both the linked lists

are different.
