Let us suppose the index of an element be (X, Y) in 0 based indexing, then the number of submatrices Sub(x,y) for this element
can be given by the formula Sub(x, y) = (X + 1) * (Y + 1) * (N – X) * (N – Y) .
This formula works because we just have to choose two different positions on the matrix that will create a submatrix that
envelopes the element. Thus, for each element, ‘sum’ can be updated as sum += Sub(x,y) * A[x][y].

More Formally,
Number of ways to choose from top-left elements (X + 1) * (Y + 1)
Number of ways to choose from bottom-right elements (N - X) * (N - Y)
