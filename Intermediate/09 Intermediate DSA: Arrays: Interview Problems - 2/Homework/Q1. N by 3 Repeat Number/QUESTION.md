Problem Description

You're given a read-only array of N integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than N/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Note: Read-only array means that the input array should not be modified in the process of solving the problem



Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= N <= 7*105
    1 <= A[i] <= 109


Input Format

The only argument is an integer array A.


Output Format

Return an integer.


    Example Input
    
    Input 1:
    [1 2 3 1 1]
    Input 2:
    [1 2 3]
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    1
    Output 2:
    -1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times.
Explanation 2:

No element occurs more than 3 / 3 = 1 times in the array.
