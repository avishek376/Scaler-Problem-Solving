Problem Description

Given an integer A. Compute and return the square root of A.
If A is not a perfect square, return floor(sqrt(A)).

The value of A can cross the range of Integer.

NOTE: 
   Do not use the sqrt function from the standard library. 
   Users are expected to solve this in O(log(A)) time.


Problem Constraints
    
    0 <= A <= 1010


Input Format

The first and only argument given is the integer A.


Output Format

Return floor(sqrt(A))


Example Input
    
    Input 1:
    
     11
    
    Input 2:
    
     9
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
     3
    
    Output 2:
    
     3


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

When A = 11 , square root of A = 3.316. It is not a perfect square so we return the floor which is 3.

Explanatino 2:

When A = 9 which is a perfect square of 3, so we return 3.
