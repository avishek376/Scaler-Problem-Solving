Problem Description

Given an array A. You have some integers given in the array B.

For the i-th number, find the frequency of B[i] in the array A and return a list containing all the frequencies.



Problem Constraints

    1 <= |A| <= 105
    
    1 <= |B| <= 105
    
    1 <= A[i] <= 105
    
    1 <= B[i] <= 105



Input Format

First argument A is an array of integers.

Second argument B is an array of integers denoting the queries.



Output Format

Return an array of integers containing frequency of the each element in B.


    
    Example Input
    
    Input 1:
    
    A = [1, 2, 1, 1]
    B = [1, 2]
    
    Input 2:
    
    A = [2, 5, 9, 2, 8]
    B = [3, 2]
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
    [3, 1]
    
    Output 2:
    
    [0, 2]



Example Explanation

For Input 1:

The frequency of 1 in the array A is 3.
The frequency of 2 in the array A is 1.

For Input 2:

The frequency of 3 in the array A is 0.

The frequency of 2 in the array A is 2.
