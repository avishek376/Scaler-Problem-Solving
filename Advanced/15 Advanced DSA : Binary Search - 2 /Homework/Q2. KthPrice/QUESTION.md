Given the price list at which tickets for a flight were purchased, figure out the kth smallest price for the flight. kth smallest price is the minimum possible n such that there are at least k price elements in the price list with value <= n. In other words, if the price list was sorted, then A[k-1] ( k is 1 based, while the array is 0 based ).

NOTE You are not allowed to modify the price list ( The price list is read only ). Try to do it using constant extra space.

Example:
    
    A : [2 1 4 3 2]
    k : 3
    
    Answer : 2

Constraints :
    
    1 <= number of elements in the price list <= 1000000
    1 <= k <= number of elements in the price list
