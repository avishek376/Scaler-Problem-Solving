add(ComplexNumber) -> Returns an object of ComplexNumber having sum of the two complex numbers.

subtract(ComplexNumber) -> Returns an object of ComplexNumber having difference of the two complex numbers.

multiply(ComplexNumber) -> Returns an object of ComplexNumber having multiplication of the two complex numbers.

divide(ComplexNumber) -> Returns an object of ComplexNumber having division of the two complex numbers.
