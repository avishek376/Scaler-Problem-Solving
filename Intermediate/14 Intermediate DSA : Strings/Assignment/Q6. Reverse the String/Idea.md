One simple approach is a two-pass solution:

First pass to split the string by spaces into an array of words
Then second pass to extract the words in reversed order
We can do better in one-pass. While iterating the string in reverse order, we keep track of a wordâ€™s beginning and end position.

When we are at the beginning of a word, we append it.
