The algorithm of selection sort should be used.
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly
finding the minimum element (considering ascending order)
from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
You need to get the minimum element to the beginning of the array
only B times as you require the Bth element.

    TC: O(N^2)
    SC: O(N)
