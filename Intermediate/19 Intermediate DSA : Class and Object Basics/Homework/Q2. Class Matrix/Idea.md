First, you need to define the properties of matrix.
For a matrix, the properties are row, column and a two dimensional array i.e arr[][].

Then you need to write constructor -
Constructor is a special function with same name as class name, and no return type.
In general, it is used to initialise the properties.
So, there will be two parameters r and c in constructor, and you can initialise row, column and arr[][].

input() -
Take the input of all elements in the arr[][].

add(x[][]) -
Create a new resultant matrix.
Then you should add the two matrices, arr[][] and x[][] and store the result in resultant matrix.
Return the resultant matrix.

subtract(x[][]) -
Create a new resultant matrix.
Then you should subtract x[][] from arr[][] and store the result in resultant matrix.
Return the resultant matrix.

transpose() -
Create a new resultant matrix.
Store the transpose of arr[][] in it.
Return the resultant matrix.

print() -
Print the arr[][].
