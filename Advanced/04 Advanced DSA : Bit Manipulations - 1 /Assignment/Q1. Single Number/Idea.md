We have noticed that if X has 1 in that position, we will have an odd number of 1s in that position.

If X has 0 in that position, we will have an odd number of 0 in that position.

Looking at the bit operators, XOR is what we need.

XOR will return 1 only on two different bits. So if two numbers are the same, XOR will return 0.

Finally, there is only one number left.

A ^ A = 0 and A ^ B ^ A = B.

So, all the even occurrences will cancel out using XOR.
