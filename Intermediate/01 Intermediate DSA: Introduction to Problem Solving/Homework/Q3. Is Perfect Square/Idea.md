Calculate the square root of A by raising it to the power of (1/2) which is 0.5.
Pass the calculated square root through the int() function and store it in a variable letâ€™s say sqrt.
Inside a if statement check if sqrt * sqrt is equal to A.
If it is then return 1, else return 0.

    TC: O(sqrt(N))
    SC: O(1)
