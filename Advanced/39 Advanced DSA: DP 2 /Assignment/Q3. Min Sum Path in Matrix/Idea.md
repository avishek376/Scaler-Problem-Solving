Let DP[i][j] store the minimum sum of numbers along the path from top left to (i,j). where 0<=i<=n-1 and 0<=j<=m-1.

Basically, DP[i][j] = A[i][j] + min(DP[i-1][j],DP[i][j-1]).

You only need to figure out the base conditions and boundary conditions now.

The answer to the problem would be simply Dp[n-1][m-1]. where n is the no. of rows and m is the no. of columns.
