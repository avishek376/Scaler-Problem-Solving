**Approach**:

1) Question states find all the rotations of B and then compare each rotation with A and increment count.
2) Here if we do B + B this string has the all the permutation of B with 1 extra.
3) If we have to make 0 by XOR operation then in B+B, lets say in X string we have to find A string occurrences.
4) As A^A == 0
