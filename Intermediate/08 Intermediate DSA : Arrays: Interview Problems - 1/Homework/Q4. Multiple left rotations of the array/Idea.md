If we are required to do K left rotations, we can append the first K elements of the array to the back and delete and delete them from the front

If K is greater than the size of the array, we can simply perform modulo on it with array size as after exact rotation of arrayâ€™s size times the array return to its original state

    TC: O(N)
    SC: O(1)
