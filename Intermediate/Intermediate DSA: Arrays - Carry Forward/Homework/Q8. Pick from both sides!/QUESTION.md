Problem Description

You are given an integer array A of size N.

You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.

Find and return the maximum possible sum of the elements that were removed after B operations.

NOTE: Suppose B = 4, and array A contains 10 elements, then

You can remove the first four elements or can remove the last four elements, or can remove 1 from front and 3 from the back, etc. You need to return the maximum possible sum of elements you can remove.


Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= N <= 105
    
    1 <= B <= N
    
    -103 <= A[i] <= 103



Input Format

First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.

    
    
    Example Input
    
    Input 1:
    
    
     A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
     B = 3
    
    Input 2:
    
    
     A = [ 2, 3, -1, 4, 2, 1 ]
     B = 4
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
    
     8
    
    Output 2:
    
    
     9
    

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Remove element 5 from front and element (1, 2) from back so we get 5 + 1 + 2 = 8
Explanation 2:

 Remove the first element and the last 3 elements. So we get 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9
