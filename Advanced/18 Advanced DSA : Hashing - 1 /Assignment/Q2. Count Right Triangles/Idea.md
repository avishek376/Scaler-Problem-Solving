Try fixing each point as the intersection of perpendicular and base and finding other points.

Once it is fixed, for the other two points, one point will share the same x-coordinate, and the other point will share the same 
y-coordinate with the selected point.

We can use a map to store the points for points sharing the same x or y coordinate.
