Problem Description

You are given two matrices A & B of same size, you have to return another matrix which is the sum of A and B.


Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= A.size(), B.size() <= 1000
    
    1 <= A[i].size(), B[i].size() <= 1000
    
    1 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1000



Input Format

The first argument is the 2D integer array A

The second argument is the 2D integer array B



Output Format

You have to return a vector of vector of integers after doing required operations.


    
    Example Input
    
    Input 1:
    
    A = [[1, 2, 3], 
         [4, 5, 6], 
         [7, 8, 9]]
    
    B = [[9, 8, 7], 
         [6, 5, 4], 
         [3, 2, 1]]
     
    Input 2:
    
    A = [[1, 2, 4], 
         [4, 5, 6], 
         [7, 8, 9]]
    
    B = [[9, 8, 6], 
         [6, 5, 4], 
         [3, 2, 1]]
     
    
    
    Example Output
    
    Output 1:
    
    [[10, 10, 10], 
     [10, 10, 10], 
     [10, 10, 10]]
    
    Output 2:
    
    [[10, 10, 10], 
     [10, 10, 10], 
     [10, 10, 10]]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

A + B = [[1+9, 2+8, 3+7],[4+6, 5+5, 6+4],[7+3, 8+2, 9+1]] = [[10, 10, 10], [10, 10, 10], [10, 10, 10]].
